# AnemiaSense
Anemia affects billions worldwide and is often under‑diagnosed because standard blood tests are interpreted manually and follow‑up is delayed. AnemiaSense leverages machine‑learning models trained on complete‑blood‑count (CBC) parameters to provide early detection, personalized treatment suggestions, and remote monitoring.

key benefits being:
| Objective                          | Impact                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Early flagging of potential anemia | Faster clinical intervention, reduced complications   |
| Personalized treatment planning    | Tailors iron/supplement dosing, reduces overtreatment |
| Remote monitoring dashboard        | Fewer in‑person visits; continuous patient engagement |

4. Prior Knowledge:
Supervised ML (classification), evaluation metrics (Accuracy / Precision / Recall / F1).
Python stack: Pandas, scikit‑learn, Flask, CSS.
Basic Anaconda for reproducible deployment on local host.
